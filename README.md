# Fraudulent-Transactions-Dataset-ANALYSIS

By Rogelio Linares Rodriguez, Kento Uematsu, Adolfo Sanpedro Gante

# Motivation
For our final project, we attempted to solve and visualize the problem of fraudulent transactions by using prediction on the model in order to determine if the recipient is valid or not as a way to predict fraudulent transactions. Our group’s plan is to prevent fraudulent activity from bad actors by developing a model to simulate a scenario regarding the danger of suspicious behavior with fraud agents.

# Prior Research
In another work, we found a github repository that handled a similar dataset that worked with fraud detection dataset that isn’t the exact dataset, however it is still relevant to the topic of discussion because they had the same goal of determining whether a transaction is fraud or not, investigate fraud behavior, find key factors of fraud, make fraud detection models in order to crack down on fraud activity. They used gradient boosting, neural networks, decision trees, and random forest for their model.

# Goals
For our goals, we constructed some goals that contain a different vision compared to prior research that aligned with our motivation of spreading awareness of fraudulent transactions regarding scenarios where bad activity could develop and attempt illegal activity with the owner’s balance. Also, we want to heavily emphasize the importance of more efficient and respectable learning models that institutions can employ for their business and customers as rule-based systems are considered vulnerable to such attacks that demand for more relevant models to protect against unethical behavior. We also wanted to apply rule-based and two other algorithms in order to determine which algorithm is more effective at finding fraudulent transactions. We want to demonstrate that we can detect fraudulent transactions without the need for neural networks or gradient boosting as this problem is considered a binary classification problem whether it is a fraudulent transaction or not.

Detailed Report in PDF FILE & Jupyter Notebook containing visualized results and graphs.

# Team Member Contributions
Rogelio worked on the machine learning algorithm, Random forest, in order to predict whether a transaction is considered fraud or not by visualizing the dataset using important features, confusion matrix, hyperparameters, and scatter plots to understand the impact fraudulent transactions can have in the modern world and looking at the dataset to get a better understanding at what bad actors really want from the crime. 

Adolfo designed, implemented and tested the Decision Tree model, worked on the project's reports, and the presentation where he explained the decision tree model’s performance.

Kento contributed to the project's documentation and presentation aspects. During the presentation, the Rule-Based Approach was explained, emphasizing its simplicity and transparency, along with its limitations in scalability and flexibility, to highlight its role as a foundational model in detecting fraudulent transactions.
